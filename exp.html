		<h1>THE LAKHE DANCE</h1>
		<p align="justify">You will come across stories of Gods and Goddesses as you walk the streets and alleys of Nepal. Where each day is a celebration of life, there are numerous festivals throughout the year. The sounds of drums and cymbals, the flute players, the masked dancers and the quiet hum of sacred chants permeate the air in processions and parades that celebrate the culture and heritage of the nation.
		
Nepal is home to the living Goddess, the Kumari – a manifestation of female divinity, who is venerated and worshiped by devotees across the country.</p>

		<h1>FOOD</h1>
		<p align="justify">Eating can be a joyful experience in Nepal. From multi cuisine and specialty restaurants and bars about town to home cooked meals from traditional kitchens, there’s a huge variety of street food to choose from too.
		
Any time is momo time. Momos are traditional dumplings that can be found in remote tea houses and with equal élan at high end restaurants. From freshly caught river fish to dried smoky meats and yak cheese, from freshly grown garden vegetables and herbs to crunchy mountain apples, from home brewed spirits to the beautiful selection of teas, there’s a whole lot waiting for your palate to discover.</p>

		<h1>HOMESTAY</h1>
		<p align="justify">Sirubari in Syangja and Ghalegaon in Lamjung were the first places to start this kind of approach to trekking. Later, other places like Kathmandu, Kavrepalanchow, Chitwan, Makwanpur, Gorkha, Ilam, Palpa, Kailali, Kalikot, and Nuwakot started to facilitate visitors with homestays.</p>

		<h1>WILD ENCOUNTERS</h1>
		<p align="justify">Explore the lush jungles of the national parks in Chitwan, Bardia and Rara on elephant backs or jeep safaris to spot rhinos grazing in the wild, crocodiles along swampy rivers, and tigers on the prowl. The wetlands of the Koshi Tappu Reserve are a bird watchers delight. Up in the mountains of Manang, you can follow the trail of the mountain goats, yaks and the elusive snow leopard. Wake up to the sounds of the forest and sink into the evening with an amazing sunset.</p>

		<h1>CRAFTS AND CREATIONS</h1>
		<p align="justify">Exquisite handicrafts flourish in Nepal. From handmade lokta paper to woven Dhaka shawls and pashmina, from artistic silver and metal ware to stone carvings, wood works and paintings, there is something magical in the hand crafted products which carry skills that have been passed down generations to retain their authentic traditional roots. You can purchase these products from a hotel store, street shops as well as custom souvenir and handicraft stores and emporiums.</p>
